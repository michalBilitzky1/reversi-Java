# reversi-Java
reversi
Reversi is a game. It consists of a 8x8 square board, and pieces with 2 colors. 
Each player has a color, and the aim of the game is to get more of your pieces on the board than the opponent's pieces. 
this repository is a design in java of the game.
I wrote the game originally in c++ and I made some changes to convert it to java, while adding features to the game view to enhance user experience
